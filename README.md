# eFRI LiDAR Handheld - Ontario Forest Inventory Field Data Collection 

Xamarin project for an Ontario eFRI LiDAR plot for field data collection

The Next Generation eFRI Ground Data Collection App is the development of a mobile field application for eFRI Ground Calibration Plots.  The application is being developed in Xamarin.Forms as an open source app that will be widely available for anyone to take the core development and expand upon it, or deploy it for an eFRI field data collection program.  The app is being deployed in Android and iOS and could also be deployed in UWP if the need arises.  The app uses SQlite on device for all data collection disconnected.  When connected, the app pushes and puls data via JSON and a REST API to an Azure SQL database.

The original eLiDAR code base (for which this is derived) lives in a public repository on Github at https://github.com/csrobins/eFRI_LiDAR_Handheld.  From here, anyone can download the full code and related components, or they can choose to modify and continue to develop the application further with their own code and solutions.
